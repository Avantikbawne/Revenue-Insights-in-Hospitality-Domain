# **Revenue-Insights-in-Hospitality-Domain**

Analyzed hospitality data to uncover key revenue trends such as occupancy rates, booking patterns, cancellations, and seasonal impacts. Generated actionable insights to help hotels optimize pricing, reduce cancellations, and maximize revenue using data visualization and predictive analytics.


****üìÑ Project Description****

The Revenue Insights in the Hospitality Domain project analyzes historical hotel booking data to derive insights that can help improve revenue management. It focuses on understanding key revenue drivers such as occupancy rates, average daily rates (ADR), cancellation trends, and market segmentation. By analyzing these factors, the project aims to provide actionable insights to optimize pricing strategies, increase revenue per available room (RevPAR), and minimize cancellations, ultimately helping hotels enhance profitability.

The analysis leverages data visualization and statistical techniques, along with machine learning algorithms, to predict booking trends and customer behavior. This information can assist hotel managers in making data-driven decisions to improve their revenue strategy.


**üö© Problem Statement**

The hospitality industry is challenged by fluctuating demand, cancellations, and competition. Hotels need to optimize their pricing strategies, minimize cancellations, and manage bookings efficiently to maximize their revenue. However, this requires a deeper understanding of customer behaviors, booking patterns, and market conditions, which is where data analytics can play a critical role.

The goal of this project is to analyze hotel booking data, identify key revenue trends, and offer recommendations for hotels to better manage pricing, occupancy, and customer engagement to increase overall revenue.


**üìä Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains information on hotel bookings, including features related to customer demographics, booking details, and stay-related information. Key columns in the dataset include:

**Booking Date:** Date when the booking was made

**Stay Duration:** Number of nights stayed

**Market Segment:** Type of customer (e.g., Online, Corporate)

**Customer Type:** Group or individual booking

**Room Type:** Category of room booked

**Lead Time: **Time in days between booking and check-in

**ADR (Average Daily Rate):** Average revenue generated per occupied room

**RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): **Total revenue divided by available rooms

**Cancellation Status: ** Whether the booking was canceled (1) or not (0)

The dataset is available on Kaggle - Hotel Booking Demand.


**üõ† Approach**

**1. Data Preprocessing**
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and transformed data types where necessary (e.g., converting dates to datetime format).
Feature Engineering: Created new features such as stay duration and lead time to help improve the analysis and model predictions.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   Conducted in-depth analysis to uncover patterns and relationships in the data, including visualizing:
   Occupancy rates and booking trends over time.
   Cancellations and their impact on revenue.
   Seasonality and its effect on ADR and RevPAR.
   Market segment and customer type influence on pricing.


**Tools used for EDA:**

Pandas: For data manipulation and transformation.
Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization and trend analysis.
Power BI: For interactive visualizations and deeper insights.

**3. Revenue Optimization Analysis**

Analyzed RevPAR and ADR to identify revenue generation opportunities.
Identified peak seasons, weekdays vs. weekends trends, and high-demand periods to recommend pricing strategies.
Examined customer segmentation to uncover insights for targeted marketing and promotional efforts.

**4. Predictive Analytics (Future Work)**
Developed a predictive model to forecast future bookings, cancellations, and room availability using machine learning algorithms (in future iterations).
Tools like scikit-learn and XGBoost could be used for training predictive models. 

**üèÜ Results**

Key insights from the analysis:

**Peak Seasons:**  Identified months and periods with the highest booking rates, allowing for targeted promotional offers and dynamic pricing.

**Cancellations:**  Found specific days of the week and seasons where cancellations were highest, enabling better booking management and cancellation policies.

**Revenue Optimization:**   Provided actionable strategies for improving pricing based on occupancy rates and seasonality, helping hotels increase ADR and RevPAR.

Visualizations of trends in occupancy, cancellations, ADR, and market segmentation were presented clearly using Power BI and Matplotlib.
